# WindowSwitcher

I work sometimes on macOS sometimes on Linux with i3wm in which I use the WindowsKey+Number to switch to switch the workspaces (that I have associated to applications).

I can't find a way to do the same on macOS by default so I created this simple simple app in which you can configure the window title (that is what I need) you want on the list and they're automatically bind to âŒ˜+n where n is the position on the list (starting at 1 :joy:).

I think it should be easy to change to other value instead the title.

No unit tests are provided since this was created for personal use and I'm not good with swift at all hehe.
